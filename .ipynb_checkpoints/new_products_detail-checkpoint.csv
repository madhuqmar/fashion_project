Bought a pair of socks from Aritzia around 2020 and it was time to get new socks!

I can not stand the fabric and the tightness. Will never buy socks from Aritzia again. I recommend you going to the store if that's possible for you so you can check the fabric beforehand.

When I ordered the tube top, I knew it could be amazing but also knew that it might be a bust… It was highly possible that there’d be a pancake boob situation- but, this tube top holds the girls in there SO well and they actually keep their shape in this top! I will definitely be buying in more colours. On top of the amazing fit, the double-lined design means that the light colours are not see-through whatsoever! I love the fit, the quality and the price!', 'i have so many of these !! they don’t slip, fit super well, and are so comfy. my absolute fav', 'I usually don’t wear tube tops because they always fall down, but this too stays up. you can also wear it without a bra!! im so glad i got a m size, my usual size is a s but i got m because i didn’t want my arms to look squished lol', 'First review I’ve ever written because it’s so worth it - I love the look of tube tops but they always fall down and I have to pull them up all day, but this hugs so perfectly. Please please restock in the pink, I was going to order and now it’s gone!', 'Doesn’t fall down. I love the way these tops fit. The recommended size fit perfectly for me.', 'Really cute! Sizing down for support and peace of mind is a MUST. It’s a really cute tube top. It will not roll if you size down. I rock this alone, under flannels, with sweats and sneakers for a casual look. Totally versatile.', 'for me personally, its hard to find a tube top that supports my larger chest. The contour tube top did not disappoint. I feel so secure!', 'Size down if you want to feel more secure. I find that sizing down helped keep my non sticky bra in place. It’s thick enough that you don’t need to wear a bra but my girls are cold all the time lol. It doesn’t feel too tight or restricting. Doesn’t roll up. Feels SO good on your body. Way better than any tube top sold elsewhere so it’s worth the price', 'Can never go wrong with anything from the contour line. Love my tube top!', 'I love how smoothing this top is! I absolutely adore the babaton contour line and this is up to par with the rest of my items. It’s not bulky at all and sucks you in nicely and the top fits comfortably slightly tucked into any bottom.', 'So happy with this top. The contour material is thick and holds everything in. Works well with large chest. The white isn’t see through.', 'so cute and so flattering. can be dressed up or down!', 'It’s layered so it’s not super thin, but it’s also breathable and comfortable, especially for summer.', 'love it, it’s long so easily tucked into pants, but can also be brought up to look more cropped! definitely purchasing more!!', 'Nothing is bad about the top it just fits a bit weird', 'I love these so much and recommend them for everyone, it’s so flattering. I really hope they restock light gum ball pink.', 'it’s okay but you can’t wear it without a bra it’s extremely see through, and when you wear a bra you get back fat because it’s so tight and you can clearly see the bra as well', 'Love, love this tube top! Fits actual size and a great everyday piece to have!', 'the fabric is such a thick, nice quality that it sucks you in. i love babaton products', ""this is a nice tube top! i am a 34b and my waist is around 28-29 inches. i do NOT have a flat stomach (a little pudge :]) and i got the medium, my usual top size for aritzia, and it fits well (both in the chest and torso area)! in a lot of tube tops, there's that sticky/elastic casing that encircles the inner top to hold up the top, but in this aritzia top, that does not exist. however, i found that even without a bra, my chest held up well. if i got a small, that'd have been too tight for me. if i got a large, i think the chest area would be too large but the waist would be a bit looser? i hope my review and measurements are helpful to someone!"", 'I’m 32A, 120 lbs, 5 ft 4 and I got a small and it fits well. It’s tight enough that it stays up and looks put together but loose enough that it doesn’t squeeze at my armpits. I probably could’ve gone with an XS but I wanted it to be comfortable. Love the contour fabric it’s so easy to dress up while still being comfy. The quality is unmatched, it stays looking brand new after washing it a million times. I recommend.', ""I am 5 ft, 95 pounds, and I have a larger bust. I needed something supportive that will cover my chest, while also being able to adjust the length according to my torso and the pants I am wearing. I ordered one size down for extra support - and since there's extra length, the smaller size doesn't affect how it fits on my torso."", 'Nice material and perfect taupe color.But my chest size is very small, even though I got xxs feels slightly big.I can feel that the top falls down but I like this top!', 'I got the green shade and I am obsessed with the colour! Great material for summer, not too thin but not too thick and true to size.', 'Really nice quality material and the perfect top for any outfit!', 'Great quality and fits nice, doesn’t fall down', 'This is the perfect tube top. Flattering, great material, stays up and is so sexy. I’m usually a size small in aritzia, and I’m a 34D and I found a small fit perfectly.', 'I have the light pink one. Its so cute and flattering. No need to wear a bra under🙏🏻🙏🏻', ""Absolutely love this top, it holds my chest up nicely so I don't have to wear a bra with it; I'm a 34DDD/36D for reference. I also sized down so that it would be tighter/more supportive. The dark pink also looks great on dark skin, highly recommend!"", 'I have bigger boobs and I can never find tube tops that don’t totally cut off the circulation around my under arms, this top totally shapes you without doing that and the material is amazing 10/10', 'I love the smoothness of the top and how it stays in place all day. So great I bought two more in different colors for this summer.', 'Very nice thick material literally one of the best tube tops ever', 'It’s perfect for spring and summer! It fits like a glove and is very flattering!', 'I loooove this top. I have it in like 4 colors. I wear it all the time during summer and even during winter with blazers! Quality fabric', 'This top is beautiful! It fits great even though I ordered a size xs I feel like a size small would have been better for me! It’s super tight fitting but still looks good! Iam a bra size 32B', 'Based on the reviews I thought it would be ok to size down. I’d suggest sticking to your regular size as it’s tight around the breast area and it rolls up.', 'I love the contour material so I had to grab this. I was worried it would fall but because the top is so sinching, I barely have to adjust. I got it in two colours', 'I got a size xs and it fits perfectly on me, so flattering and can be worn cropped or pulled down to come to your belly button. It does come down a little bit but nothing to the point where it bothered me or was annoying. I got black, and then I ordered pearl and navy blue a few days after because I liked it so much. My cousin just ordered one too.', 'it fit great and was comfey, super cute', 'fits great, looks great', 'Very high quality, hugs all the right places, perfect length (not tooo cropped)!', 'I wore this for a party and inevitably had to pull it up every now and then but was so perfectly fitted for a tube top. It was so comfortable and flattering. I wear a 34C bra and this held the girls in perfectly with nothing underneath.']"
